Sebeknefru, queen who ruled as king of ancient Egypt (c. 1760–c. 1756 BCE); she was the last ruler of the 12th dynasty (1938–c. 1756 BCE).

The end of the long reign of Sebeknefru’s father, Amenemhet III, brought her half brother to the throne late in life. When her brother died, the absence of a male heir made Sebeknefru the closest in line of succession; she thus took the royal titles and ruled as king. Hers was not a precedent-setting reign, however, for a similar succession had apparently occurred at the end of the 6th dynasty (c. 2325–c. 2150 BCE).

Sebeknefru reigned as a full pharaoh; her statues show her with full royal (king’s) regalia and in traditional royal poses. Nonetheless, she made no attempt to depict herself as a man, as did Queen Hatshepsut of the 18th dynasty (1539–1292 BCE). Sebeknefru’s highest regnal year date—three—is indicated at the Second Nile Cataract, one of the sites at which the annual inundation level was recorded.
