Ras Muhammad National Park is located in Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula. It is found at the most southern tip of the peninsula.  The national park encompasses an area of 185 square miles (480 sq km).  This was the first national park for Egypt.

Of the 185 square miles (480 sq km), 133 square miles (345 sq km) is marine and protects the Red Sea Reef.  Along with the Red Sea Reef, there are two islands just off the peninsula which are part of the parkâ€™s protected area.

On land, the park protects a small mangrove forest at the end of the peninsula.  Further inland, the landscapes include mountains, sand dunes, wadis, and coastal mud plains.

The Red Sea Reef and surrounding reef areas include both fringing and hermatypic type reefs.  There are over 220 species of corals accompanied by over 1,000 species of fish, 40 species of starfish, 150 species of crustaceans, and 25 species of sea urchins.

The green turtle and the hawksbill turtle are two of the sea turtles which can be found swimming amongst the reefs fairly regularly.

The Red Sea is the most northern tropical sea and it stretches 1,400 miles (2,250 km) with a surface area of 169,000 square miles (438,000 sq km).  The Ras Muhammad National Park only protects a small portion of the Red Sea Reef.
