Khufu Statue

This statue depicts King Khufu (known to the Greeks as Cheops), the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Ironically, this small, 7.5‑cm‑tall, statuette is the only confirmed contemporary three‑dimensional of this king. When it was first discovered, the head was missing. Noticing that the break was recent, Sir Flinders Petrie, aware of the importance of the find, ordered a search for the missing head, which was finally discovered three weeks later.
