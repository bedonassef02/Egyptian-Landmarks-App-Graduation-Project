Serapeum At Sakkara

Over a timespan of circa 1400 years, from the New Kingdom to the Ptolemaic Period, at least sixty Apis are attested to have been interred at the Serapeum. The earliest burials are found in isolated tombs, as the cult gained importance underground galleries were dug that connected subsequent burial chambers. One of the cult practices involved the dedication of commemorative stone tablets with dates relating to the life and death of the Apis. This data was crucial for the establishment of an Egyptian chronology in the 19th century.

It is part of the Saqqara necropolis, which includes several animal catacombs, notably the burial vaults of the mother-cows of the Apis.
