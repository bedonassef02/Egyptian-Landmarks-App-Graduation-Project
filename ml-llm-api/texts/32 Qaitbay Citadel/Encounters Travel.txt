The Citadel of Qaitbay is an ancient fortress located on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. It was built in the 15th century by Sultan Qaitbay, a Mamluk ruler of Egypt and Syria. The Citadel is one of the most impressive examples of Islamic military architecture in the world and has been standing for more than 500 years.

The Citadel of Qaitbay began in 1477 under Sultan Qaitbay, a Mamluk ruler, from 1468 to 1496. He was a great patron of architecture and wanted to build a fortress to protect Alexandria from Ottoman invasion. He chose a strategic spot on the Mediterranean coast for his fortress, close to important trade routes. The Citadel was designed by an architect named Al-Gawhari, who had previously worked on several other projects for Sultan Qaitbay.

The design of the Citadel of Qaitbay is based on traditional Islamic military architecture, with high walls and towers surrounding an inner courtyard. The walls are made from limestone blocks and are up to 20 meters high in some places. The towers are square or octagonal and have crenellations along their tops for defense purposes. Inside the Citadel are several buildings, including a mosque, barracks, storehouses and residential quarters. 

The construction of the Citadel took around ten years to complete, and it quickly became an important defensive structure in Alexandria's coastal defenses against Ottoman forces. In 1517 it successfully repelled an attack by Ottoman forces under Selim I, which earned it great fame throughout Egypt and beyond. In 1543 it also played a key role in repelling another attack by Ottoman forces under Suleiman I, cementing its reputation as one of Egypt's most formidable fortresses. 

In later centuries, the Citadel continued to be used as a defensive structure against foreign invaders but also served other purposes such as housing prisoners or providing shelter during times of famine or plague outbreaks. It even served as a prison for French soldiers during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798-99! 

The Citadel is still strong after more than 500 years since its construction began in 1477 by Sultan Qaitbay. It has become one of Alexandria's most iconic landmarks and is visited by thousands yearly who admire its impressive architecture and learn about its rich history.

The Citadel of Qaitbay is an iconic structure located on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. Built in the 15th century, it stands as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of its builders. The architecture of the Citadel is a reflection of its time, combining elements from both Islamic and European styles. The Citadel is an impressive structure, with imposing walls, towers, and gates that have withstood the test of time.

The Citadel was built by Sultan Qaitbay in 1477 to protect Alexandria from attack by sea. It was constructed with limestone blocks taken from the ruins of the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1303. The design of the Citadel was based on a combination of Islamic and European styles, reflecting the influence of both cultures at that time. 

The most striking feature of the Citadel is its massive walls, which are up to 40 feet high and over three feet thick. These walls were designed to withstand attacks from cannons and other weapons used during that period. They are also decorated with inscriptions and carvings that reflect both Islamic and European influences. 

The walls are punctuated by four large towers at each corner; two round towers at the northeast and southwest corners and two square towers at the northwest and southeast corners. Each building has its unique design; some feature pointed domes, while others have flat roofs or conical caps. These towers were designed to provide an additional defense against attackers and offer lookout points for spotting potential threats from afar. 

The entrance to the Citadel is through a large gate known as Bab al-Bahr (Gate of Sea). This gate is flanked by two smaller gates known as Bab al-Qasr (Gate of Palace) and Bab al-Gama'a (Gate of Mosque). All three gates are decorated with intricate carvings depicting scenes from Islamic history and symbols related to military power, such as swords, shields, flags, lances etc. 

Inside the Citadel are several buildings, including a mosque, palace, barracks for soldiers, storehouses for supplies etc., all built in accordance with traditional Islamic architecture but also incorporating elements from European styles such as pointed arches and ribbed vaults. The palace was designed for comfort rather than defense; it features large windows overlooking gardens filled with fruit trees and flowers providing shade during hot days while allowing light into its spacious rooms during cooler weather.
