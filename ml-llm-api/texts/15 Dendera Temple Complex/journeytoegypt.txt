Dendera (Arabic: دَنْدَرة Dandarah; Ancient Greek: Τεντυρις or Τεντυρα; Bohairic Coptic: ⲛⲓⲧⲉⲛⲧⲱⲣⲓ, romanized: Nitentōri; Sahidic Coptic: ⲛⲓⲧⲛⲧⲱⲣⲉ, romanized: Nitntōre),[1][2] also spelled Denderah, ancient Iunet 𓉺𓈖𓏏𓊖 “jwn.t”,[3] Tentyris[4][5],(Arabic: Ewan-t إيوان-ة ),[6] or Tentyra[7] is a small town and former bishopric in Egypt situated on the west bank of the Nile, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of Qena, on the opposite side of the river. It is located approximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of Luxor and remains a Latin Catholic titular see. It contains the Dendera Temple complex, one of the best-preserved temple sites from ancient Upper Egypt.
In the vicinity of the temple complex a bakery dated to the First Intermediate Period was discovered by the French-Polish expedition from the Institut français d’archéologie orientale (IFAO) and the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw. Bread offered to Hathor was baked here.[15] The team also excavated the so-called Eastern Temple in this area.[16]

The area around the temple has been extensively landscaped and now has a modern visitor centre, bazaar and small cafeteria.

Ecclesiastical history
After Egypt became a Roman possession, the city of Tentyris was part of the Late Roman province of Thebais Secunda. Its bishopric was a suffragan of Ptolemais Hermiou, the capital and metropolitan see of the province. Little is known of the history of Christianity in the place, as only the names of two ancient bishops are given:

Pachomius the Great, generally recognized as the founder of Christian cenobitic monasticism
Serapion or Aprion, a contemporary and friend of the monk Pachomius, whose diocese boasted the celebrated convent of Tabenna.
The town was given its present Arabic name of Denderah during the late Ottoman Empire and ruled 6000 inhabitants in Qena (Qeneh) district.

Titular see
Under the Latin name Tentyris, the episcopal see was nominally revived as a titular bishopric (in Curiate Italian repeatedly renamed) since 1902, but is vacant since 1972,[17] having had the following incumbents of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank :

Matteo Gaughren, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.) (1902.01.13 – 1914.05.30)
Emile-Marie Bunoz, O.M.I. (1917.06.13 – 1945.06.03)
André van den Bronk, Society of African Missions (S.M.A.) (1946.07.30 – 1952.05.15)
Teodoro Bensch (1956.12.01 – 1958.01.07)
Jean-Rosière-Eugène Arnaud, Paris Foreign Missions Society (M.E.P.) (1958.03.02 – 1972.09.11).
Climate
This area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Dendera has a hot desert climate, abbreviated "BWh" on climate maps.[18]
