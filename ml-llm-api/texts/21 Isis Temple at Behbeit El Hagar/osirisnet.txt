Behbeit el Hagar
isis Temple at Behbeit El Hagar

South west of provincial capital Al Mansura (in the northern delta) lays Behbeit el Hagar. It holds the impressive remains of a Shrine to the goddess Isis, as can be seen from the names of the location in classical antiquity, Iseum or Isidis oppidum. The Arabic name for the village, Behbeit, still contains the pharaonic name Hebyt. The temple now lies in ruins but the complex (1170 x 680 feet or 360 x 210 meters) is enclosed by a great wall built of unfired Nile mud tiles, while the temple itself covered an area 260 x 178 feet (80 x 55 meters) the temple building has totally collapsed, probably due to an earthquake, and now the visitor finds only a confusion of granite blocks and other architectural fragments.
