## Problem Statement

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="left">
  Even though Egypt has many famous landmarks, there aren't many easy and engaging ways for tourists and locals to learn about them. Traditional guides and websites often provide boring, static information. Our app solves this problem by offering a dynamic, AI-driven platform to make learning about these sites more interactive and personalized.
